# Project-LeighSyndrome
## Nishaal's MSc project:
Providing accurate prognosis to patients suffering from Leigh syndrome is an unresolved challenge for clinicians. This is due to the huge number of variables that effect the prognosis of this disease. The aim of this project will be to build machine learning models that are appropriate for our data, can predict clinical outcomes for patients and are interpretable.      

 [**Machine Learning for Leigh Syndrome notebook**](https://github.com/atifkhanncl/Project-LeighSyndrome/blob/main/DeepHitLeighSyndrome.ipynb)
1. This project was built in an environment with the following essential libraries: 
    - python 3.7.1 
    - tensorflow 2.0.0
    - lifelines 0.26.0
    - scikit-learn 0.24.2
    - scikit-survival 0.15.0
    - eli5 0.11.0

2. To install essential libraries run: 
```
    pip install lifelines 
    pip install scikit-learn
    pip install scikit-survival
    pip install eli5
```

3. Define the path to data when running the script


 [**DeepHit for Leigh Syndrome notebook**](https://github.com/atifkhanncl/Project-LeighSyndrome/blob/main/MachineLearningLeighSyndrome.ipynb)
1. The DeepHit source code needs to be cloned from [DeepHit](https://github.com/chl8856/DeepHit)
3. Define path to data
2. Define path for  ` % run '.py'` statements for DeepHit repo in local drive
