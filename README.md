# Project-LeighSyndrome
## Nishaal's MSc project:
Providing accurate prognosis to patients suffering from Leigh syndrome is an unresolved challenge for clinicians. This is due to the huge number of variables that effect the prognosis of this disease. The aim of this project will be to build machine learning models that are appropriate for our data, can predict clinical outcomes for patients and are interpretable.
